# gothic-gravitons
source code for the @gothicgravitons twitter bot. 
this is a fairly terrible twitter bot i wrote in spring 2015; it markov-chains single words 
(i plan to add bigrams sometimes when i'm just bored enough to work on this and still motivated enough to, you know, actually write code.)
you will need a twitter api key (such that the tweepy module works); a few text files you want to mash up (they are helpfully called text1, text2, and text3 in the source code). 
also be aware that if your source text contains offensive language (the sound and the fury is a prime example) you may want to pre-screen the tweets so you are aware of what you are sending out into the internet.
that is all for now.
